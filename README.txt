FILE DESCRIPTION
****************************************

VectorRoutingSim - Simulates all 3 algorithms

FileParser - Reads in data from text files (network and events)

Router - Represents router in network

RoutingTable - Represents internal routing table for each router

Network - Represented by a simple weighted graph

TopologicalEvent - Represents each event that occurs during the simulation

ViaMap - Submap for Routing Table

Tuple - Holds cost and number of hops for a specific path between routers


****************************************
INSTRUCTIONS
